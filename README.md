## Introduction to Localization based on probabilistic robotics

## What is localization?

- Where the car is in a given map within an accuracy of 10cm or less.
- Onboard sensors are used to estimate transformation between measurements and a given map.
- In only Localization have to assume that we have a good map first, because without it, either won't work or won't work vey well.
- How can we know where we are with 10cm accuracy? â†’ Have to use Localization technique.
